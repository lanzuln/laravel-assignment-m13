First of all, I open terminal
then select my targeted directory.
then write this command: composer global require laravel/installer
then write this command: laravel new laravel-project
then write: cd laravel-project
then write: php artisan serve
then get the live link


ok, that's the initial process of getting started on the laravel project.
